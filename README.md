# instagram
A utility tool for Instagram with pre-set features in order to increase recognition on your account

# Note: Selenium is ugly, I wouldn't recommend using any automated usage on your account (it's just social media)

This Instagram script uses InstaPy and will go through multiple processes on your account

**Features**
-Specifically looks for small accounts and will like their most recent post (high chances of getting a follow)

-10% chance of following found user, unfollows the user after 10-20 minutes if they do not follow back (randomised from 1-5 users at a time)

-15% chance of commenting on found user's post
 
Every process is executed within 10-25 seconds in order to avoid Instagram detection, however this is not guranteed. 
It is recommended to leave this running when you are away in order to get the best use out of this.
